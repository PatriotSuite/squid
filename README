Patriot Proxy
=============

Patriot Proxy is an HTTP proxy server based on the open source 
Squid server that ensures that all of your communications and interactions
with the web use the Patriot Suite APIs.

By using the Patriot Suite APIs, every time that you access a web site, 
download data from the network, comment on a web site, upload data or
perform any activities with the web, the information is encrypted and
stored for the appropriate government agencies to review it and track it.

By installing this proxy in your organization, you can ensure that all
of your users contribute to increase their own Patriot Points and allow
the government to ensure their ongoing allegiance to Patriotic Values.
